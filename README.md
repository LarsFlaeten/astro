# astro

WORK IN PROGRESS

Astro is a collection of astrodynamics-related classes and helper functions. In addition it wraps much of the functionality of NAIF's SPICE toolkit, but provides an interface in modern C++ fashion.

Math library is based on the Ork math templates.

Put cspice headers and libcspice.a in `libraries/cspice/` (not included in this repo)
